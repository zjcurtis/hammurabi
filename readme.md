This is my rather poor attempt at translating an ancient legal code into something resembling logic. Any errors or omissions are mine, and not Yale's or Hammurabi's.

## TODOs

- [ ] unify similar predicates between laws (award_property, award_fine, etc)
- [ ] fines predicates need to go from one entity to another, with an amount, and for a reason
- [ ] the housing laws need a unified handling of time. 30-31.
- [ ] invalid sale and forfeiture of money are probably the same thing.

## Notes:

Laws 33 and 34 are missing information on *who* the penalty applies to.
